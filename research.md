 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Abstract </summary>
      <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper assesses the impact of in utero and early-childhood exposure to wildfire smoke on longevity as well as economic achievement, human capital accumulation, and disability in mid-to-late adulthood. To identify areas that were exposed to wildfire pollution, we leverage mid-20th century (1930-1969) California wildfires and smoke dispersion modeling. We then combine these wildfire pollution data with comprehensive, restricted-use administrative data from the Social Security Administration and Census Bureau.  These linked data allow us to measure childhood wildfire smoke exposure for four decades of birth cohorts and to observe a rich set of later-life outcomes. Using these data, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in smoke exposure--which is a function of fire timing and size as well as wind direction and speed--to identify long-run effects. We find that moving from the 25th to 75th percentile of early-life wildfire smoke exposure results in 1.7 additional deaths before age 55 per 1,000 individuals, conditional on surviving past early childhood. Aggregating these effects across ages 30 to 80 translates to 46 life years lost per 1,000 persons. We further find that smoke exposure results in unfavorable changes to a wide range of later-life outcomes across economic achievement, educational attainment, and disability measures. From these results, we estimate that each child born in California during our sample period sustained, on average, approximately $22,000 of discounted damages in lost life expectancy and lost earnings due to wildfire smoke. These findings suggest that warming temperatures, which exacerbate the duration and intensity of wildfire seasons, are already meaningfully affecting the life cycles of exposed children through increased smoke exposure.

 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper identifies an important spillover associated with public health insurance: reduced incarceration. In 1990, Congress passed legislation that  increased Medicaid eligibility for individuals born after September 30, 1983. We show that Black children born just after the cutoff are 5 percent less likely to be incarcerated by age 28, driven primarily by a decrease in incarcerations connected to financially motivated offenses. Children of other races, who experienced almost no gain in Medicaid coverage as a result of the policy, demonstrate no such declines. We find that reduced incarceration in adulthood substantially offsets the initial costs of expanding eligibility. </p>

#### <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/papers/Practice_structure.pdf">*How Do Medicare Payments Influence Physician Practice Structure?*</a> 

<details>
 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Abstract </summary>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper exploits spatial discontinuities in Medicare payment rates to estimate the effect of reimbursements on primary care physicians’ choice of organizational structure. I find that a 1 percent increase in Medicare reimbursement leads to a 1.7 to 2.2 percentage point increase in primary care doctors who practice with a small group (defined as 25 providers or fewer). This effect is driven by changes in the tails of the practice size distribution: a 1.8 percentage point increase in physicians who are affiliated with the smallest (1- or 2-provider) practice groups with a corresponding decrease in physicians joining very large practices (≥ 150 providers). I do not, however, detect any evidence of physician sorting or bunching around the boundary in response to differential payment, supporting the underlying assumptions of my regression discontinuity design. Accordingly, my findings suggest that Medicare pricing may be a factor in the trend of consolidation in the physician and clinical services market. </p>

#### *Does a Stitch in Time Save Nine? The Long-Run Effects of Hospital Access [Part of Census RDC Project #2272]* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with <a href="https://samuelarenberg.com/">Sam Arenberg</a> </i></p>

<details>
 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This project will study the long-term impacts of childhood hospital access on health, human capital, and economic outcomes in adulthood. To do so, we will leverage variation in childhood hospital access from the Hill-Burton hospital construction program, linked to administrative birth and death records as well as outcomes in the restricted-use Decennial Census and American Community Surveys. Because the Hill-Burton program disproportionately increased hospitals in predominately Black areas, we examine whether these expanded medical resources closed gaps in outcomes among Black Americans. </p>

#### *Air Pollution, Educational Outcomes, and Long-Term Incarceration [Part of Texas ERC Project #155]* <br/>

 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> There is now substantial evidence that air pollution negatively impacts student outcomes. However, less is known about the mechanisms, critical periods, and potential long-term consequences of pollution exposure in later childhood and early adolescence. This project will utilize rich longitudinal data from the Texas Educational Research Center on student outcomes and school characteristics, linked with later-life incarceration data to better understand the impacts of air pollution and its later-life outcomes. </p>

#### *From Classroom to Labor Market: The Divergent Paths of Black and White Americans [Part of Texas ERC Project #155]* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with <a href="https://anjalipverma.github.io/">Anjali P. Verma</a> and <a href="https://samuelarenberg.com/">Sam Arenberg</a> </i></p>

 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This project studies test-score and income gaps between Black and white Americans. We investigate these gaps using longitudinal administrative education and earnings records from the Texas Education Resource Center, focusing on a panel of children from recent cohorts (1986-91) who are observed continuously from 3rd grade through age 30. Our headline finding is that Black students performing at the 80th percentile of test scores have earnings in early adulthood similar to white students performing at the 20th percentile of test scores. We also find stark differences in the persistence of relative performance. Black students with low test scores are very likely to have low earnings, while white students with low test scores demonstrate much more upward mobility. Conversely, Black students with high test scores demonstrate a greater degree downward mobility than white students with high test scores. Ongoing work decomposes the gaps into differences in high school graduation, college enrollment, major choice, industry, and location. Our findings, although descriptive, appear inconsistent with a popular narrative that closing test-score gaps between Black and white Americans would substantially reduce the gaps that appear at later ages in labor market outcomes.

#### *How Does Opioid Prevalence Affect Surgery Decisions?* <br/>
<p style="font-size:70%;"><i> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/davidbeheshti">David Beheshti</a> </i></p>

<details>
 <summary style="font-size:80%;"> Project Summary </summary>
     <p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> This paper studies how the prevalence of opioids affects joint physician-patient decisions over medical procedures. Following Alpert et al. (2019), we utilize variation in OxyContin exposure due to state policies that affected OxyContin's marketing and market entry. Preliminary results suggest that higher availability of opioids led to a substantial increase in the number of discretionary surgical discharges (e.g., knee replacements, hip replacements, and back surgeries), but did not meaningfully affect discharges for non-discretionary surgical procedures or medical discharges. </p>
