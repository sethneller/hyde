## About Me
<p align="justify" style="font-size:80%;"> I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tennessee. <br/>
<br/>  
  
My research primarily focuses on the long-run effects of health shocks, particularly those occurring during childhood. My <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/papers/neller_jmp_ashes_to_ashes.pdf" style="color:#bf5700;">job market paper</a> investigates the effect of early-life pollution exposure from California wildfires occurring in the mid-20th century in order to better understand how childhood health affects longevity, economic achievement, and disability in mid-to-late adulthood. In other work (with <a href="https://samuelarenberg.com/" style="color:#bf5700;">Sam Arenberg</a> and Sam Stripling), we investigate how additional Medicaid coverage in late childhood and early adolescence reduces the likelihood of incarceration as adults. <br/>
<br/>
  
In addition to my research in early-life determinants, I am also interested in the determinants of physician practice structure and treatment styles. You can view my <a href="https://sethneller.github.io/research.html" style="color:#bf5700;">research page</a> for current and upcoming projects.  </p>
